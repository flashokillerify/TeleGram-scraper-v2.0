nHello !!!!!, 



How its works?????



- you must install Python 3



- Install telethon using cmd  command: pip3 install telethon\

-Get your Api and Hash id from www.my.telegram.org/auth

-add detials to scrapper.py and adder.py

-Run scrapper.py and scrap group members.

-Run adder.py and add scrapped members to your group





Basically it scrapes member from group where the logined id is admin and it creates a .csv file.

And the adder reads .csv file and add member to the target group.
